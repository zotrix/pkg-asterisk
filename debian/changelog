  * Remove libgtk2.0-dev from Build-Depends since the GTK+ console was not
    getting built anyway.

  [ Kilian Krause ]
  * Add dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.19) to Build-Depends for binary:Version and
    source:Version.

  [ Faidon Liambotis ]
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #439062)
    - AST-2007-020 Resource Exhaustion vulnerability in SIP channel driver
  * Switch to quilt as a patch management system instead of dpatch.
  * Add bristuff 0.4.0-test4
    - Split into smaller, individual patches (bristuff/).
    - Mention HFC-S/HFC-4S support in the Description.
    - Use libpri-bristuffed.so.1 and its respective header
      (use-libpri-bristuffed).
    - Ship xagi-test.c as an example.
    - Add a news item to NEWS.Debian stating bristuff's inclusion.
  * Major overhaul of the postinst scripts, completely replacing asterisk_fix.
    - Create Asterisk's directories on asterisk.dirs to track them using dpkg.
    - Add asterisk.postinst which calls adduser, chown, chmod. Improve error
      handling.
    - Don't do unnecessary stuff on asterisk-config postinst.
      (Closes: #431506)
    - chmod /etc/asterisk on build-time to allow the user to modify the
      permissions; this required a lintian override.
    - Honor dpkg-statoverride on all the chowned/chmoded directories and
      configuration files under /etc/asterisk.
    - Handle asterisk-config -> asterisk installation order properly
      (Closes: #408708)
    - Don't add asterisk user to audio and dialout groups if existed before.
      This allows the administrator to remove the membership.
    - Don't depend on adduser from asterisk-config.
  * Remove Suggests to gnomemeeting (it's a dummy package nowdays),
    asterisk-rate-engine and add one for twinkle.
  * Remove Conflicts for an old version of asterisk-oh323 which was only
    present until sarge.
  * Remove versioned dependencies on ancient (pre-sarge) versions of sed and
    adduser.
  * Patch channels/h323/ast_h323.cxx to add some missing PTRACING #ifdef
    (h323-add-missing-ptrace-guard).
  * h323-workaround-openh323-segfault patch: workaround a libopenh323 bug
    (#438815) which causes Asterisk to segfault on startup. (Closes: #435146)
  * Remove -XCVS from dh_installexamples arguments. Upstream doesn't use CVS
    anymore.
  * Add a README.Debian for asterisk-h323 that explains the differences
    between the different H.323 channel drivers, taken from the asterisk-oh323
    package.

    chmod on postinst.
  * Correct descriptions of packages in debian/control, adapting them to the
    present and correcting some spelling mistakes. (Closes: #428671)
  * Add a noload directive for cdr_sqlite.so in the default modules.conf since
    it writes unconditionally to the database file without being rotated,

  * debian/asterisk.init: Added grace timeout of 2 secs before hard shutting
    down running daemons to don't scatter incorrect warnings. Don't run the
    asterisk daemon unless RUNASTERISK=yes. (Will not bind ports from chroots)
  * debian/asterisk-config.default: Disabled autostart - especially when
    installing in chroots this was quite annoying.
  * debian/rules: Remove the asterisk.8.gz recompression. (Closes: #295220)
  * debian/README.Debian: Added first version. Thanks to Tzafrir Cohen for the
    template! (Closes: #270072)
  * debian/asterisk.deafult: moved the /etc/default to the asterisk package,
    as /etc/init.d/asterisk in there needs it.
  * debian/80_skinny.dpatch: Added
    http://bugs.digium.com/bug_view_page.php?bug_id=0003496. Thanks to Johan
    ThelmÃ©n <johan.thelmen@cygate.se>. (Closes:#295658)
  * debian/control: remove chan_h323 from being built for now. For now it's
    being replaced by asterisk-oh323 until chan_h323 does build and work ok
    with latest OpenH323 again.

asterisk (1:1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian VoIP Team upload.
  * New upstream release.

  * Kilian Krause:
    - debian/asterisk.init: fixed multiple GID problem when starting asterisk (as
      reported by Raoul BÃ¶nisch and Simon Peter). Unfortunatelly this does
      remove the chance to run as real-time prio.
    - debian/asterisk.init: fixed stale stop by using start-stop-server after
      soft shutdown (Closes: #263879)
    - debian/asterisk.init: Fixed running as root problem for #279052. At least
      through the /etc/init.d/asterisk you won't be able to run asterisk as
      root (not even with another username). (Closes: #279052)
    - debian/asterisk.init: Added switch to run asterisk via safe_asterisk
      optionally for automatic restart (Closes: #266805)
    - debian/patches/01_security_hotfix_287851.dpatch: Removed, as is
      incorporated in 1.0.4 upstream release.

  * Jose Carlos
    - debian/rules: add a check at build time for fpm sounds. If they exist,
      abort, as we must remember to remove those from sources in each new
      upstream release.
    - debian/patches: 20_Makefile.dpatch: updated

      as the license for them is not DFSG compliant (Closes: #288429)
    - applied patch to make asterisk compile on amd64 with 
      gcc-4.0 (Closes: #288831)
    - debian/asterisk.init:
      + Changed how daemon is restarted in init file. (Closes: #287025)
      + Using -r in checks in init file. (Closes: #287456)
    - debian/asterisk-config.default
      + Run by default as group asterisk.
    - Fix some lintian warnings and errors:
      + Description: should start with lowercase letter.
      + Bumped Standars-Version to 3.6.1. No changes needed.
      + Removed duplicate dependencies.
      + Recompress asterisk.8 manpage with max level (--best option)
