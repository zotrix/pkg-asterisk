# This file allows you to alter the configuration of the Asterisk
# init.d script
#
# RUNASTERISK: run asterisk upon boot. Should be set to "yes" once you have
#              setup your configuration.
RUNASTERISK=no
#
#
# AST_REALTIME: if set to anything other than "no", asterisk will run in 
#               real-time priority (pass '-p' to asterisk). un-rem the 
#               following line to disable asterisk from running in real-time 
#               priority
#AST_REALTIME=yes
#
# PARAMS: extra parameters to pass to asterisk
#         The example here may help you in debugging, but is 
#         *not**intended**for**production**use*.
#         When you give -G *only* that group will be used,
#         else all groups of the asterisk user.
#PARAMS="-D -g -vvv"
#
#
# RUNASTSAFE: run safe_asterisk rather than asterisk (will auto-restart upon
#             crash)
#RUNASTSAFE=yes
