* chan_h323/openh323 linking. See comment in patch h323-no-deps-on-asterisk
* The asterisk canary dies on startup sometimes. Canary is anyway not needed
  on Lenny kernel (>= 2.6.25). But if it dies we lose the effect of 
  real-time priority.
  - Though it seems like upstream is deprecating chan_h323.
* Canary is not killed when Asterisk is stopped (?)
* Some man pages to write.
* Get rid of the lump of code in patch mpglib. Rewrite using code from mpg123?
