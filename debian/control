Description: Open Source Private Branch Exchange (PBX)
 Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit.  It is, in a
 sense, middleware between Internet and telephony channels on the bottom,
 and Internet and telephony applications at the top.
 .
 Asterisk can be used with Voice over IP (SIP, H.323, IAX and more) standards,
 or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) through supported hardware.
 .
 Supported hardware:
 .
  * All Wildcard (tm) ISDN PRI cards from Digium (http://www.digium.com)
  * HFC-S/HFC-4S-based ISDN BRI cards (Junghanns.NET, beroNet, Digium etc.)
  * All TDM (FXO/FXS) cards from Digium
  * Various clones of Digium cards such as those by OpenVox
  * Xorcom Astribank USB telephony adapter (http://www.xorcom.com)
  * Voicetronix OpenPCI, OpenLine and OpenSwitch cards
  * CAPI-compatible ISDN cards (using the add-on package chan-capi)
  * Full Duplex Sound Card (ALSA or OSS) supported by Linux
  * Tormenta T1/E1 card (http://www.zapatatelephony.org)
  * QuickNet Internet PhoneJack and LineJack (http://www.quicknet.net)
 .
 This is the main package that includes the Asterisk daemon and most channel
 drivers and applications.

Package: asterisk-h323
Architecture: any
Depends: asterisk, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: H.323 protocol support for the Asterisk PBX
 Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit.
 .
 This channel driver (chan_h323) provides support for the H.323 protocol
 for Asterisk. This is an implementation originally contributed by NuFone and
 nowdays maintained and distributed by Digium, Inc. Hence, it is considered 
 the official H.323 chanel driver.
 .
 This is one of many H.323 channel implementations for Asterisk with others
 being chan_oh323 and chan_ooh323c, distributed by Debian as asterisk-oh323 and
 asterisk-ooh323c, respectively.
 .

 package.
