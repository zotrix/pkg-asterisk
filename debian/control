Description: H.323 protocol support for Asterisk
 Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit.
 .
 This channel driver (chan_h323) provides support for the H.323 protocol
 for Asterisk. This is an implementation originally contributed by NuFone and
 nowdays maintained and distributed by Digium, Inc. Hence, it is considered 
 the official H.323 chanel driver.
 .
 This is one of many H.323 channel implementations for Asterisk with others
 being chan_oh323 and chan_ooh323c, distributed by Debian as asterisk-oh323 and
 asterisk-ooh323c, respectively.
