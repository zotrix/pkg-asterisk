asterisk (1:1.4.2~dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * With the release of asterisk 1.4.x to unstable the asterisk-classic &
    asterisk-bristuff packages have been depreciated. We
    are awaiting bristuff compatible with asterisk 1.4 
  * If you require bristuff, it is recommended you stick
    with the packages in etch.

asterisk (1:1.0.7.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Debian version of the upstream asterisk source has had the fpm Music on Hold
    removed as this music has only been licenced for use within asterisk which is
    incompatible with the Debian Free Software Guildlines 
    <http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines>. Please drop your alternative
    Music on Hold into the directory /usr/share/asterisk/mohmp3/
