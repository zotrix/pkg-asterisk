H.323 support moved towards asterisk-oh323
==========================================
The asterisk source package no longer includes support for H323, but only for
SIP and IAX (v1 and v2). The H323 support was reported to be mostly broken
anyway, so please try asterisk-oh323 as a replacement for chan_h323.
