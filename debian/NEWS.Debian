Debian asterisk-xxx.dfsg.tar.gz
===============================
The Debian version of the upstream asterisk source has had the fpm Music on Hold
removed as this music has only been licenced for use within asterisk which is
incompatible with the Debian Free Software Guildlines 
<http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines>. Please drop your alternative
Music on Hold into the directory /usr/share/asterisk/mohmp3/
