Welcome to the world of telephone switch owners. Asterisk is a quite powerful
and probably one of the feature-richest open-source PBXes out there. To get you
a brief impression where to start tweaking, we've included this doc. (Thanks to
Tzafrir Cohen for a proposal of this)

File Locations
==============
See /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf for pathnames. All the configuration is done
from the *.conf files there.

Sounds reside at /usr/share/asterisk/sounds. Voicemail mailboxes are below
/var/spool/asterisk/voicemail using symlinks.

User, Groups, Permissions
=========================
By default the package will create user and group 'asterisk' and will run as
them. It will optionally run with real-time priority (-p). It will also add
itself to the group audio to enable the daemon to access sound cards. Running
as root is disabled in /etc/init.d/asterisk for security reasons. If you use
zaptel devices (like zaphfc too), you need to set permissions on /dev/zap to
root.dialout or whatever other group you like and add the asterisk user to that
group. Then make sure all the devicenodes below /dev/zap/ are 660 or asterisk
will not have any access still. When no -G is given to the asterisk PARAMS,
then asterisk will automatically initialize all groups of the asterisk user. 

To change those values you can edit /etc/default/asterisk. You need to set
RUNASTERISK=yes to make asterisk autostart upon boot.

init.d Script Commands
======================
In addition to reload, that runs the asterisk CLI command 'reload' there
are also extensions-reload ('extensions reload') and logger-reload 
('logger-reload') to load only parts of the configuration file. 

Asterisk supports a number of non-default paramters at startup.  For debugging
it is often useful to run 'asterisk -U asterisk -vvvgc' from the console.  Add
more -v for even higher verbosity. You can attach a remote console to a running
asterisk daemon with 'asterisk -vcr'.  When testing, make sure to use the "-U
asterisk", or asterisk may write files with root ownership. In that case you
might not be able to restart the daemon without altering permissions to the
files first.


External Libraries
==================
The package no longer includes support for h323, but for sip and iax (v1 and
v2). The h323 support is reported to be mostly broken, so please try
asterisk-oh323 for a better H323 support.

Getting started with config and more features
=============================================
Of course the default config is far from a plug'n'play for every environment.
You need to setup a proper dialplan in extensions.conf, remove the demo entries
and maybe remove FreeWorldDialup too in case you don't participate there. For
more info on how to setup a proper dialplan, fax, enum and configuration of
asterisk, please checkout
